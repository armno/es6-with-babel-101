# babel-101

Learning ES6 and Babel via [tower-of-babel](https://github.com/yosuke-furukawa/tower-of-babel).

## random notes taken

- My first impression to Template String is meh. But it comes pretty handy for printing a string that contains many variables in it.
- `extends` and `super` reminds me of Java somehow...
- A module can export `const` and `function`.
- ES6: `export`, CommonJS: `exports`
- ES6: `import {} from <PATH>`, CommonJS: `require()`
- `export default` so importing doesn't require `{}`.
